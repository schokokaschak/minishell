# minishell

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.
At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned
1/0 switches was seriously irritating.
It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat
close to the human language.
Thanks to Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didn’t exist.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/schokokaschak/minishell.git && cd minishell
```
``` bash
make all && ./minishell
```

## Requierments by the subject
### Mandatory

+ Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
+ Have a working history.
+ Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
+ Not use more than one global variable. Think about it. You will have to explain its purpose.
+ Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
+ Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
+ Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
+ Implement redirections:
  + '<' should redirect input.
  + '>' should redirect output.
  + '<<' should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
  + '>>' should redirect output in append mode.
+ Implement pipes | . The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
+ Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
+ Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
+ Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
+ In interactive mode:
  + ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
  + ctrl-D exits the shell.
  + ctrl-\ does nothing.
+ Your shell must implement the following builtins:
  + echo with option -n
  + cd with only a relative or absolute path
  + pwd with no options
  + export with no options
  + unset with no options
  + env with no options or arguments
  + exit with no options

### Bonus

+ && and || with parenthesis for priorities.
+ Wildcards * should work for the current working directory
